# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a classic math game for kids. Players take turns counting, while replacing any number divisible by 3 with
the word "fizz", any number divisible by 5 with the word "buzz" and any number divisible by both with the word
"fizzbuzz". This project will be able to play the game on its own, giving the solution between any interval. It will
also be able to play against the user up to the given number.
